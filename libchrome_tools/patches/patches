# This file will be used by emerge in libchrome-XXXX.ebuild to determine the
# order of applying patches.
#
# Support selectively applying patch by use flag, examples:
# * To apply foo.patch to every board, add
#   `foo.patch`
# * To apply foo.patch to board bar only, add
#   `foo.patch board_use_bar`
# * To apply foo.patch to board installing package baz only, add
#   `foo.patch board_use_baz`
# Note: add flag to IUSE in libchrome ebuild if it is not already there.
