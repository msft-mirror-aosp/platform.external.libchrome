This directory provides a stub implementation of perfetto.

Perfetto backs libchrome tracing. Disabling tracing creates divergence between
libchrome and Chromium. But we would prefer not to have tracing really enabled
at this momenet.
So we introduced a stub implementation of perfetto, so we can enable tracing on
libchrome but it doesn't do anything underlying.
